# localflavor-si-tax-test
This is just a test for django-localflavor==1.2 for slovenian tax number validation. There was an error when validating tax number where control number is 11.

Before running install required packages (virtualenv is recommended):
    pip install requirements.txt

There are two scripts: test.py (to execute test) and tax_generator.py (to generate random tax numbers)
